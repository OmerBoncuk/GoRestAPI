> ‚ö†Ô∏è For real projects, it is recommended to store tokens securely using environment variables or secret managers.

## ‚úÖ Test Scripts

Each request includes basic tests to verify response status codes. Example test:

```javascript
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

// Save the UserID for further requests
var UserID = pm.response.json().id;
pm.collectionVariables.set("UserID", UserID);
